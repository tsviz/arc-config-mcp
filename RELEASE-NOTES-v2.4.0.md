## üöÄ Migration Guide

### **For Existing Installations**

1. **Check ARC Version**: Verify your current ARC version
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment -n arc-systems -o yaml | grep image:
   ```

2. **Upgrade to v0.13.0+**: If not already on v0.13.0+, follow [official ARC upgrade guide](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller)

3. **Update MCP Server**: Pull the new v2.4.0 image
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/tsviz/arc-config-mcp:v2.4.0
   ```

4. **Test Cleanup**: Use dry-run mode first
   ```bash
   arc_cleanup_installation --dryRun=true
   ```
