## Route Selection Guide

Choose your route based on **current circumstances**:

### Route 1: Quick Win (2-3 hours) 🎯 **RECOMMENDED FOR IMMEDIATE VALUE**
**When to use:**
- Need to demonstrate working features quickly
- Want to ship something usable today
- Time-constrained environment
- Testing concept viability

**What you get:**
- Policy evaluation with live resources (works with cluster)
- Compliance reports from running ARC instances
- Natural language command execution
- Basic cluster operations (namespace management)

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Focus on high-value, low-complexity features
1. Implement getNamespace + createNamespace (30 min)
2. Implement listDeployments (actual K8s API) (30 min)
3. Register policy tools in index.ts (30 min)
4. Register NL router in index.ts (30 min)
5. Test with real cluster (30 min)
```

**Decision Point**: Choose this if you answered "Yes" to:
- [ ] Need working features within 2-3 hours?
- [ ] Have a Kubernetes cluster available for testing?
- [ ] Want to show progress quickly?

- Have dedicated time block
- Quality over speed

**What you get:**
- All 14 service methods fully implemented
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Docker container support

### Route 3: Hybrid Approach (4-6 hours) ⚡ **RECOMMENDED FOR BALANCED PROGRESS**
**When to use:**
- Want meaningful progress today
- Willing to iterate
- Need some features working, others can wait
- Balanced time/value tradeoff

**What you get:**
- Core features fully working (installation, monitoring)
- Advanced features stubbed (deletion, backups)
- Partial test coverage
- Clear TODOs for remaining work

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Strategic feature selection
Phase 1: Critical Path (2h)
- Implement methods for installation flow
- Basic namespace + deployment operations
- Secret management

Phase 2: Value Add (1h)
- Policy engine integration
- NL router integration
- Compliance reporting

Phase 3: Testing (1h)
- Integration tests for critical path
- Manual testing with cluster

Phase 4: Documentation (30min)
- Update README with what works
- Document what's stubbed

Phase 5: Polish (30min)
- Error handling improvements
- Logging enhancements
```

**Decision Point**: Choose this if you answered "Yes" to:
- [ ] Want progress today but not rushed?
- [ ] Okay with some features being stubs?
- [ ] Planning to iterate over time?
- [ ] Have 4-6 hours available?

## Circumstance-Based Decision Tree

### Scenario 1: "I need a demo tomorrow"
**Route**: Quick Win (Route 1)  
**Focus**: Policy engine demo with YAML files (works now!) + basic cluster status  
**Time**: 2-3 hours today, polish tomorrow AM  
**Risk**: Low - already have working policy engine

### Scenario 2: "Building this for our team to use"
**Route**: Full Integration (Route 2)  
**Focus**: Complete, tested, production-ready implementation  
**Time**: Schedule 1-2 days  
**Risk**: Medium - more code to write, but systematic approach

### Scenario 3: "Want to make progress but have interruptions"
**Route**: Hybrid (Route 3)  
**Focus**: Implement features incrementally, commit often  
**Time**: Multiple 1-2 hour sessions over a few days  
**Risk**: Low - small, testable increments

### Scenario 4: "Just exploring MCP capabilities"
**Route**: Stay at Tier 1  
**Focus**: Use policy engine + NL parser as-is to learn MCP patterns  
**Time**: 0 hours (already done!)  
**Risk**: None - educational value without implementation

### Scenario 5: "Need one specific feature working"
**Route**: Surgical Implementation  
**Focus**: Implement only the methods needed for that feature  
**Time**: 30min - 2 hours depending on feature  
**Risk**: Very Low - targeted, minimal changes

**Required Methods:**
- ✅ `createNamespace` - STUB READY (Tier 1 done)
- ✅ `waitForDeployment` - STUB READY (Tier 1 done)
- ✅ `createSecret` - STUB READY (Tier 1 done)
- ⚠️ Needs: Actual implementation of above 3

**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Value**: High - core feature

### Feature: Monitor ARC Status
**Required Methods:**
- ✅ `listDeployments` - STUB READY
- ✅ `getPodLogs` - STUB READY
- ⚠️ Needs: Actual implementation of above 2

**Time**: 1 hour  
**Value**: High - essential for ops

### Feature: Policy Compliance Report
**Required Methods:**
- ✅ `getCustomResources` - STUB READY
- ✅ Policy Engine - COMPLETE ✅
- ⚠️ Needs: getCustomResources implementation + tool registration

**Time**: 1.5 hours  
**Value**: Medium-High - governance

### Feature: Natural Language Operations
**Required Methods:**
- ✅ NL Parser - COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ All tool registrations
- ⚠️ Needs: Tool registration in index.ts

**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Value**: High - UX differentiator

### Feature: Uninstall ARC
**Required Methods:**
- ✅ `deleteCustomResources` - STUB READY (safety guard)
- ✅ `deleteHelmRelease` - STUB READY
- ✅ `deleteNamespace` - STUB READY (blocked for safety)
- ⚠️ Needs: Safety mechanisms + actual implementation

**Time**: 2 hours (includes safety checks)  
**Value**: Low - rarely used, high risk

## Real-Time Adaptation Strategy

### If circumstances change mid-implementation:

#### Scenario: "Ran out of time, need to ship now"
**Action**: 
1. Commit current work
2. Update README with what works
3. Mark TODOs clearly
4. Ship Tier 1 + partial Tier 2
5. Schedule follow-up

#### Scenario: "Need changes more features than expected"
**Action**:
1. Re-evaluate against Feature Dependency Map
2. Implement only blocking dependencies
3. Accept stubs for nice-to-have features
4. Document upgrade path

#### Scenario: "Found critical bug/limitation"
**Action**:
1. Fix immediately if Tier 1 affected
2. Add to backlog if Tier 2+
3. Update ADAPTIVE_STRATEGY.md with learning
4. Continue with current route

#### Scenario: "Requirements changed"
**Action**:
1. Assess impact on implemented features
2. Refactor if necessary (safe with TypeScript)
3. Update documentation
4. Adjust route if needed

## Current Recommendation

Based on **all circumstances** analysis:

### 🎯 PRIMARY: Route 3 (Hybrid) - 4-6 hours

**Why:**
1. You have working foundation (Tier 1 ✅)
2. Best balance of value and time
3. Allows iteration and learning
4. Low risk of "wasted" work
5. Can ship meaningful features today

**Start Here:**
```bash
# Phase 1: Pick ONE feature that matters most
# Example: Policy evaluation with live resources

# Implement just the methods needed:
1. Edit src/services/kubernetes.ts
2. Replace getCustomResources stub with real implementation
3. Test with your cluster
4. Register policy tools in index.ts
5. Ship and celebrate! 🎉

# Then repeat for next feature
```

### 🔄 FALLBACK: Route 1 (Quick Win) - 2-3 hours

**If hybrid seems too much:**
- Pick smaller scope
- Focus on demo/POC value
- Accept more stubs
- Ship even faster

### 🚀 UPGRADE: Route 2 (Full) - 1-2 days

**If you have time and want completion:**
- Schedule dedicated time block
- Systematic implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Production-ready outcome
